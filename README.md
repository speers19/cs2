Final project from my Computer Science 2 class
Most of my work in this class was filling code into the skeletons of Java games created by my instructor, Peter Drake.
This game based on the light cycle battles from TRON was made completely from scratch, so it's the only project I'm putting in this repository.
It's a two player game. Have fun!
